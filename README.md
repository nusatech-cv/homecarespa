# HomeCareSPA

HomeCareSPA is an extensive, scalable software architecture, providing an adaptable platform for developing intricate software applications. This project offers a vast span of features, including configurations, templates, scripts, and libraries that aid in building and managing complex applications.

## Project Structure

The project contains several key directories and files:

- `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`: They're used by Bundler to manage the Ruby gem dependencies for the project.
- `Rakefile`: Contains various tasks that are used to manage and run different parts of the application.
- `bin`: Holds executables. The `install.sh`, `gen_key.sh`, and `start.sh` scripts handle project setup and initialization.
- `compose`: Contains Docker Compose configuration files.
- `config`: Holds the application's configuration files like environment variables, API keys, etc.
- `lib`: Contains application-specific libraries that carry out tasks like rendering and vault management.
- `templates`: Features template files (`*.erb`) used by Ruby to dynamically produce configurations.
- `terraform`: Contains files necessary for handling infrastructure management using Terraform.

## Usage

There is 3 ways to build the application on server using this project:

### 1. Using SHELL Scripts

#### Installation

1. Clone the project repository to your remote server.
2. Navigate into the directory containing the project.
3. Make sure to change `config/app.example.yml` into `config/app.yml` and fill with the actual data.
4. Run the generator key script: `./bin/gen_key.sh`
5. Run the install script: `./bin/install.sh`

#### Starting the Application

After installation is completed, you can run the application using the start script: `./bin/start.sh`

### 2. Using Tasks of Rake

#### Leveraging Rake Tasks

The project encapsulates a series of Rake tasks that enable smooth project management. These tasks are invoked through the `rake` command followed by the respective task name. Here is a brief overview of the tasks:

- `rake render:config`: Renders configuration files and keys by collating data specified in the compose files.

- `rake service:all[command]`, `rake service:app[command]`, `rake service:backend[command]`, `rake service:proxy[command]`, `rake service:setup[command]`: These tasks manage different architectural components, including the application, backend services, the Traefik reverse proxy, and Vault setup. They take a command argument that can be `start`, `stop`, `restart`, etc.

- `rake terraform:apply`, `rake terraform:destroy`, `rake terraform:init`, `rake terraform:install`: These tasks allow comprehensive management of the application's infrastructure using Terraform.

- `rake vault:setup`: It initializes, unseals and sets secrets for Vault, enabling secure secret management for the application. 

To probe further into the specifics of each task, explore the `Rakefile` as well as the individual `*.rake` task files inside the `lib/tasks` directory.

#### Running the Services

1. Clone the project repository to your remote server.
2. Navigate into the directory containing the project.
3. Make sure to change `config/app.example.yml` into `config/app.yml` and fill with the actual data.
4. Run the generator key script: `./bin/gen_key.sh`

You can start all the components of the application using the Rake task `service:all`. This command will initiate all services including the application, backend services, and the Traefik reverse proxy.

```bash
$ rake service:all[start]
```

The `[start]` argument signifies that you want to start the services. You can replace `start` with `stop` to stop the services, or `restart` to restart the services. If your Vault requires setup, you can run:

```bash
$ rake service:setup[start]
```

### 3. Using Terraform for Infrastructure Management

#### Build the Platform

The project infrastructure is managed using Terraform. In order to utilize Terraform for setting up your infrastructure, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the directory containing the project.
3. Make sure to change `config/app.example.yml` into `config/app.yml` and fill with the actual data.
4. Run the generator key script: `./bin/gen_key.sh`

5. First, install Terraform: 

```bash
$ rake terraform:install
```

6. Then initialize your Terraform configuration:

```bash
$ rake terraform:init
```
  
This will initialize your working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration.

7. You can preview the changes to be applied using: 

```bash
$ rake terraform:plan
```

This command will determine what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files.

8. To implement the changes, you can run:

```bash
$ rake terraform:apply
```
  
With this, Terraform will apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration.

If at any point you want to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure, run:

```bash
$ rake terraform:destroy
```

Remember, working with Terraform requires knowledge about cloud resources. If you need to manage the infrastructure in a different cloud environment or need a different setup for your resources, make sure to update the Terraform files in the `terraform` directory accordingly.

## Conclusion

HomeCareSPA provides a flexible and adaptable foundation for developing complex solutions. With services encapsulated as Rake tasks, it offers a high level of abstraction to perform the common tasks necessary to manage a web project â€“ from handling infrastructure using Terraform to managing Dockerized services with individual tasks. Having a solid understanding of these tools is vital for maximizing the efficiency and smooth operation of the project.
